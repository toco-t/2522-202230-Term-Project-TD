BREAKING NEWS - Russia Declares War On Japan
Newscaster: After two weeks of brutal attacks on Tokyo, the Russian Army has officially declared war on Japan just one hour ago.
Newscaster: The Japan Self-Defense Force is mobilizing to protect our citizens from the invasion.
Newscaster: We remind citizens to stay indoors as much as possible. We will return with more news after a speech by Shikikan Raiden.
Ayumi: What happened while I was gone?
Miyako: You didn’t hear about any of this while you were overseas?
Ayumi: Nothing.
Miyako: About a month ago, the Russian Army stationed troops around Manchuria. They were able to catch us off guard and invade Japan.
Ayumi: But... didn’t the Russian Army falter after the attacks on Ukraine? Why are they invading us instead?
Ayumi: And didn’t the previous President get overthrown? I thought the new President was more democratic and supported by the West.
Miyako: The whole situation is confusing to everybody here. And if nobody outside Japan knows, we may silently fall.
Miyako: We’ve got to regroup with the rest of our squad.
Ayumi: Kitsune Squad... are they in battle right now?
Miyako: They’re stationed near Shibuya, ready to protect the city.
Miyako: Finish your curry, we don’t have much time left.
Ayumi: At the entrance... two Russian Army infantry.
???: Подайте нам карри или мы будем стрелять!
Miyako: Does anybody know what they’re saying?
Ayumi: I don’t know, but I don’t see any weapons on them.
Miyako: Just keep a close eye on them.
???: У вас есть пять секунд!
Ayumi: They don’t seem like they’re in a good mood...
Miyako: Do you have your submachine gun?
Ayumi: ...Yes.
Miyako: Approach them slowly, maybe we can talk with them.
???: Открытый огонь!
The Russians draw handguns and open fire. More of them appear from the exit.
Miyako: Get down, Ayu!
Ayumi: Dammit!
Miyako: We’ve got to close in and attack! On me!
Ayumi: Right behind you!
